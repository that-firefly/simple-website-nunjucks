**Serverless.** It's kind of a phenomenon. Let's get one thing out of the way: it still involves servers, so that word _serverless_ might feel a bit disingenuous. It's actually a new way to pay for and work with servers that, in many cases, is _cheaper_ and _easier_ than buying and managing your own servers.

Web developers of all kinds can take advantage of it, but **this site is particularly interested in how it relates to and helps front-end web developers**. Here's one way to think about it: you can take your front-end skills and do things that typically only a back-end can do. You can write a JavaScript function that you run and receive a response from by hitting a URL. That's sometimes also called _Cloud Functions_ or _Functions as a Service_, which are perhaps better names, but just a part of the whole serverless thing.

Here's an empowering example: saving and reading things from a database. That's right! It's possible to have a database and deal with it entirely through front-end code. Technically, the database still exists on a server (someone's else's computer, as [the famous sticker](/images/there-is-no-cloud.jpg) says), but you don't need to spin up your own server for it to have a home.

Why bother with doing a database this way? For one thing, it means you can host the rest of your site much more easily. Wanna build a [React](https://reactjs.org/)-powered blog on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)? You totally can! Wanna use the super fast static file host [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) powered portfolio site? Do it.

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/) is a part of this brave new world as well. CodePen can be the home of your front-end code that talks to cloud functions and cloud data. Your serverless host in a serverless world! This very site is built statically with [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) and hosted on CodePen using [CodePen Projects](https://codepen.io/pro/projects).
